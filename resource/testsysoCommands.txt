list of commands this program responds to
Currently, commands are.
****************************************************************
new:			create a new Matrix

showmap:                Iterate through main and each entry..........
showMap:                Disp each Mx with ModCmd, ModTS, & Create TS	

showListSpecs           iterate through main and show size of each item
showlistspecs           iterate through main and show size of each item

ls mx                   ** Still working on this
ls mx by name           Same As Above
list matrix name        Same As Above

scalerMult              Get a scaler value: Multiply currentMx by Scaler
scalermult              Same As Above

devmult                 Get a scaler value: Multiply currentMx by Scaler...
multDev                 Find where the change MX goes.....
multdev                 Put the new MX value away.

pop:			Test int x cast to char(x)

pickmatrix              Get usr name string input.....
pickmx                  compare matrix name values with input....
setCurrName             set currentMatrix variable to matrix from the list....
setcurrname             with that same name.  This is not ideal name for this operation

setCurrentName          Get a Mx Name Char: Find that entry: Make it current

ls:			This command
list:			This command
listcmd:		This command

ls mx:			coded to run 'showmap'
ls mx by name:		coded to run 'showmap'
list matrix name:	coded to run 'showmap'

cls:        currently this will clear Screen in a windows session
            the Linux/Git Bash do not respond.

default: fall through to default in the switch statement....
         echo that cmd 'X' was not found ....
         try Again.  Then 'ls' cmd is primed into processor
         and allowed to run naturally.

quit: but this isn't a switch entry its in the loop control check
